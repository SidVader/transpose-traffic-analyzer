- We aim to build a City Traffic Dashboard, which would be proficient in extracting out major transport challenges and problems faced by 4 cities namely- Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Kolkata.

- The dashboard will be preliminary based on social data, print data and open government data.

- It would provide visual insights into cityâ€™s biggest traffic problems, and facilitate better monitoring of transport.

- It aims to ease the traffic system.

- We would achieve this, through data mining techniques such as sentiment analysis, soft computing tools, and information extraction techniques.

- Twitter and Facebook extracted data were examined using NLP(Natural Language Processing).
